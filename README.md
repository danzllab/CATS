This code is developed for the paper "Uncovering brain tissue architecture across scales with super-resolution light microscopy" 

The repository consists of 2 parts, which provide analysis of coCATS and rCATS data.
1) [coCATS analysis](./cocats_image-analysis/)
2) [rCATS analysis](./rcats_image-analysis/)

More detailed instructions can be found in each folder.
